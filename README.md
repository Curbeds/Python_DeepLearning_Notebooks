# Python_DeepLearning_Notebooks
This repository is a curated collection of deep learning notebooks. While working as data science interns during spring 2019, various working codes for diverse neural net architectures were crafted. The repository includes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Bidirectional LSTM, CNN and RNN in tandem, and Capsule Nets. Complementary code for preprocessing the ASV Spoof 2019 dataset in its train, development, and test versions are also incorporated within the repository, which was specifically used while participating in the ASV Spoof 2019 Challenge.
